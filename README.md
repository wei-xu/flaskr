# How to run this app

under the root directory, install the package as an app

`pip install -e .`

`export FLASK_APP=flaskr`

`export FLASK_ENV=development`

to enable db, after doing exporting env, do

`flask init-db`

run server

`flask run`

or publicly visible

`flask run --host 0.0.0.0`

# Question

- What if I want to run two ap``ps simultaneously
- How `app.add_url_route` works

# TODO
